# Project Overview â€“ Revenue AI: Cognitive Analyst Challenge

This project is a two-part solution developed for the **Revenue AI â€“ Cognitive Analyst Probation Task**, focused on Airbnb operations in Europe. It blends **data-driven pricing analytics** with **agentic user journey optimization**, addressing both strategic insight and technical execution.

## Task 1 â€“ Barcelona Pricing Analytics

Using the latest [Inside Airbnb datasets](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for Barcelona, I conducted a comprehensive pricing analysis to identify key trends across **room types**, **neighborhoods**, and **seasonal patterns**.  

The project features:
- Python-based data processing
- A Tableau dashboard highlighting:
  - Average nightly prices
  - Listing availability
  - Guest engagement metrics  
- ðŸ“Š **View the Dashboard**: [Barcelona Airbnb Pricing Analysis on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/BarcelonaAirbnbPricingAnalysis/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Final recommendations were tailored to **Javier, Airbnbâ€™s Revenue Optimization Manager**, to guide host pricing strategies that align with market demand and seasonal trends.

## Task 2 â€“ Budapest Booking Workflow Optimization

The second phase involved redesigning a booking system for Budapest properties by planning two complementary workflows:

1. **Manual UX Journey** â€“ focused on reducing friction and improving clarity across the user flow.
2. **AI-Driven Agentic Workflow** â€“ powered by:
   - `RAI Base` (user interaction + booking automation)
   - `RAI Price` (real-time pricing optimization)
   - `Postman Flows` (backend API orchestration)
   - `OpenAI` (natural language understanding and intent resolution)

By identifying a key pain point at the **payment stage**, I integrated:
- Simplified payment flows
- Trust signals
- Progress indicators
- Automated reminders

These enhancements reduce drop-offs and **increase booking completion rates**.  
Both workflows were visualized and compared to support **Javierâ€™s dual strategy**â€”offering users both flexibility and automation through an intelligent system design.

# ðŸ“Š Revenue AI: Cognitive Analyst Challenge â€“ Airbnb Pricing & Booking Intelligence

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the **Revenue AI â€“ Cognitive Analyst Probation Task** and consists of two core components focused on Airbnbâ€™s European operations. The work combines exploratory data analysis, data engineering, and UX optimization to surface pricing insights and streamline booking workflows using both manual and AI-enhanced methods.

---

## Task 1 â€“ Barcelona Pricing Analytics

Using publicly available datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), this task involved a full descriptive analysis of listing performance in **Barcelona**. The primary goal was to uncover patterns in nightly pricing, neighborhood dynamics, and seasonality to inform pricing strategy decisions.

### ðŸ“Œ Proposed Approach for Analysis
To ensure a robust and insight-driven process, the following steps were implemented:

1. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
   - Removed nulls in critical fields (e.g., price, room type, ID)
   - Filtered listings to a valid price range (`0â€“850 EUR`) to eliminate outliers
   - Ensured valid date fields for time-based analysis
   - Removed duplicate entries using `ROW_NUMBER()` and kept only the latest records

2. **Data Integration**
   - Base table: `listings_viz`
   - Left joined with `listings` to pull in:
     - `review_scores_rating`
     - `estimated_revenue_l365d`
     - `bedrooms`, `beds`, `bathrooms`
   - Left joined with `reviews_viz` to bring in:
     - `review_date`

3. **Descriptive Analysis (SQL & Tableau)**
   - Seasonality trends: Monthly average pricing across years
   - Neighborhood-level price comparison
   - Room type vs. revenue performance
   - Guest review trends (total volume, recent engagement)
   - Distribution across price bands and estimated revenue

### ðŸ§® Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
- SQL (BigQuery)
- Tableau (Dashboarding)
- Excel (initial validation)

### ðŸ“ˆ View Dashboard
ðŸ‘‰ [Barcelona Airbnb Pricing Analysis â€“ Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/BarcelonaAirbnbPricingAnalysis/Dashboard2)

### ðŸ’¡ Final Recommendations
Tailored for Javier, Airbnbâ€™s Revenue Optimization Manager:
- Prioritize premium pricing in high-demand neighborhoods (e.g., Eixample, Sant MartÃ­)
- Promote full-home listings in spring months to capitalize on seasonality
- Use budget-friendly room types in slower months and low-engagement areas
- Target a citywide average price benchmark (~â‚¬140) for competitive alignment

## Task 2 â€“ Budapest Booking Workflow Optimization

The second phase involved redesigning the booking system for Airbnb properties in Budapest. Two parallel user journeys were proposed to reduce friction and optimize revenue potential:

### ðŸ›  Manual UX Journey
- Streamlined UI with clearer booking options
- Simplified payment flows
- Use of trust signals and progress indicators

### ðŸ¤– AI-Driven Agentic Workflow
Powered by:
- **RAI Base** â€“ handles interaction and booking logic
- **RAI Price** â€“ supports real-time dynamic pricing
- **Postman Flows** â€“ manages backend orchestration
- **OpenAI** â€“ understands user intent and personalizes responses

These intelligent workflows reduce user confusion and drop-off while increasing conversion rates and completion velocity.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates a complete analytical pipeline, from raw data preparation to business recommendations. The dual focus on pricing insights and product flow optimization enables Javier and his team to:

- Provide data-driven advice to Airbnb hosts
- Adapt booking flows for both manual and automated experiences
- Maximize revenue through strategic pricing and customer experience design

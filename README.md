# Project Overview – Revenue AI: Cognitive Analyst Challenge

This project is a two-part solution developed for the **Revenue AI – Cognitive Analyst Probation Task**, focused on Airbnb operations in Europe. It blends **data-driven pricing analytics** with **agentic user journey optimization**, addressing both strategic insight and technical execution.

## Task 1 – Barcelona Pricing Analytics

Using the latest [Inside Airbnb datasets](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for Barcelona, I conducted a comprehensive pricing analysis to identify key trends across **room types**, **neighborhoods**, and **seasonal patterns**.  

The project features:
- Python-based data processing
- A Tableau dashboard highlighting:
  - Average nightly prices
  - Listing availability
  - Guest engagement metrics  
- 📊 **View the Dashboard**: [Barcelona Airbnb Pricing Analysis on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/BarcelonaAirbnbPricingAnalysis/Dashboard2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Final recommendations were tailored to **Javier, Airbnb’s Revenue Optimization Manager**, to guide host pricing strategies that align with market demand and seasonal trends.

## Task 2 – Budapest Booking Workflow Optimization

The second phase involved redesigning a booking system for Budapest properties by planning two complementary workflows:

1. **Manual UX Journey** – focused on reducing friction and improving clarity across the user flow.
2. **AI-Driven Agentic Workflow** – powered by:
   - `RAI Base` (user interaction + booking automation)
   - `RAI Price` (real-time pricing optimization)
   - `Postman Flows` (backend API orchestration)
   - `OpenAI` (natural language understanding and intent resolution)

By identifying a key pain point at the **payment stage**, I integrated:
- Simplified payment flows
- Trust signals
- Progress indicators
- Automated reminders

These enhancements reduce drop-offs and **increase booking completion rates**.  
Both workflows were visualized and compared to support **Javier’s dual strategy**—offering users both flexibility and automation through an intelligent system design.
